## Course Description
An introduction to protein structure and molecular interactions needed for analysis of individual proteins. Focus on proteins that highlight important biophysical properties. Project-based course emphasizing reading and interpretation of the original literature. The groups of protein chosen can be biological machines, including ribosomes and protein synthesis; actin/myosin and muscle motion; kinesin/dynesin, transport, and cellular motion and deformation; and bacterial flagellar action. Alternatively the class can study processes based on transmembrane potential gradients including respiration, photosynthesis and chemiosmotic energy coupling as well as nerve function.

- Locate research sources (including academic journal articles, magazine and newspaper articles) in the libraryâ€™s databases or archives and on the Internet and evaluate them for credibility, accuracy, timeliness, and bias.
- Compose texts that integrate your stance with appropriate sources using strategies such as summary, critical analysis, interpretation, synthesis, and argumentation.
- Practice systematic application of citation conventions.

## First-Year Composition Mission Statement
First-year composition courses at CCNY teach writing as a recursive and frequently collaborative process of invention, drafting, and revising. Writing is both personal and social, and students should learn how to write for different purposes and audiences. Since writing is a process of making meaning and communicating, FYC teachers respond mainly to the content of studentsâ€™ writing as well as to recurring surface errors. Students should expect frequent written and oral responses on the content of their writing from their teachers and peers. Classes rely heavily on a workshop format. Instruction emphasizes the connection between writing, reading, and critical thinking; students should give thoughtful, reasoned responses to the readings. Both reading and writing are the subjects of class discussions and workshops, and students are expected to be active participants in the classroom community. Learning from each other will be a large part of the classroom experience.

## Plagiarism and Academic Integrity (just don't do it.)
Plagiarism is copying and using other peopleâ€™s words without proper acknowledgment or citation as it is indicated in the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity. All writing submitted for this course is understood to be your original work. Plagiarism is unacceptable and has serious consequences that can include a failing grade. In cases where I detect academic dishonesty (the fraudulent submission of anotherâ€™s work, in whole or part, as your own), you may be subject to a failing grade for the project or the course, and, in the worst case, to academic probation or expulsion. You are expected to read, understand, and adhere to CCNYâ€™s Policy on Academic Integrity, which is available here: http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/current/upload/Academic-Integrity-Policy.pdf .
