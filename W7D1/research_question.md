title: What defines a good research question?
---

## Exercise: Are these good research questions? Why?
1. Is coffee good or bad?
2. The history of coffee.
3. Why do people drink coffee?
4. How do we solve coffee breath?
5. How many cups of espresso a day are most beneficial to human bodies?
6. How many cups of espresso a day would maximize one's blood oxgyen?
7. How many cups of espresso a day would maximally extend one's life expectancy?

## Research question and hypothesis driven-test
If you can derive a feasibily testable, falsifiable hypothesis from your research question, that's a good research question.

(falsifiable: a theory is falsifiable if it is contradicted by an observation that is logically possible)

## Research question criteria
### Scope
- Wide enough so that it's relevant.
- Narrow enough so that you can get your hands on.

### Feasibility
- Doable within the limit of resources.
- You're equipped with the right toolking and are well-positioned to conduct such research.

### Impact
- Will the results be interesting to you and to others?
- Does it concern a real and debatable issue?
