title: What defines a good research question?
---

## Research question and hypothesis driven-test
If you can not derive a testable, falsifiable hypothesis from your research question, that's not a research question.

(falsifiable: a theory is falsifiable if it is contradicted by an observation that is logically possible)

## Research question criteria
### Scope
- Wide enough so that it's relevant.
- Narrow enough so that you can get your hands on.

### Feasibility
- Doable within the limit of resources.
- You're equipped with the right toolking and are well-positioned to conduct such research.

### Impact
- Will the results be interesting to you and to others?
- Does it concern a real and debatable issue?
