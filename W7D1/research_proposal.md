title: How to write research proposals?
---

## Components
### Abstract (Optional)
- A condensed version of your purposal: one could read it to decide whether to continue reading.
- One sentence summarizes one section.

### Introduction
- **Be gentle**: target a readership slightly wider than your targeted audience for the rest of your proposal/research paper. Start with general level knowledge and go into details later.
- **Highlight significance**: What's the status quo? What's wrong? Why would I care?
- **Provide a statement of your research question / hypothesis.**
- If you're not doing a separate literature review, do it briefly here.

### Literature Review (Optional)
- Give recognition to other scholars in this field.
- What has been studied? What is left to study?

### Methodology / Theoretical Framework
- Describe in detail your research design, methods, procedures, and tools.
- Describe your theoretical approach
- Describe the sources you would use
- Describe the details of your methods

### Agenda / Timeline
- What are the milestones?
- When would you hit those milestones?
- (Optional) How would you spend your money?

### Boarder Impact (Optional) 
- From a macroscopic point of view, how would my research make the world a better/worse place?
