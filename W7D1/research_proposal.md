title: How to write research proposals?
---
## Requirements
See also [Essay2 Requirements](../W6D2/essay2.md).

The proposal should identify the specific, final research question that you determine based on your initial exploration/research. Your proposal should discuss the same ideas as the topic reflection, but should be a more finely tuned presentation of the question your research will explore. You will need to include:

- Your research question with some context. What is it about this question that interests you? Why is it relevant to social justice or social action?
- A timeline; by what point will you have completed research for secondary sources?
- A description of your audience and the name of a publication and a model essay (with a URL, if relevant) for which your essay might be appropriate.
- A bibliography of the work you have so far completed.

## Components
### Abstract (Optional)
- A condensed version of your purposal: one could read it to decide whether to continue reading.
- One sentence summarizes one section.

### Introduction
- **Be gentle**: target a readership slightly wider than your targeted audience for the rest of your proposal/research paper. Start with general level knowledge and go into details later.
- **Highlight significance**: What's the status quo? What's wrong? Why would I care?
- **Provide a statement of your research question / hypothesis.**
- If you're not doing a separate literature review, do it briefly here.

### Literature Review (Optional)
- Give recognition to other scholars in this field.
- What has been studied? What is left to study?

### Objectives & Goals & Significance
- Microscopically: What will be done?
- Marcoscopically: What influence will this research make?

### Methodology / Theoretical Framework
- Describe in detail your research design, methods, procedures, and tools.
- Describe your theoretical approach
- Describe the sources you would use
- Describe the details of your methods

### Agenda / Timeline
- What are the milestones?
- When would you hit those milestones?
- (Optional) How would you spend your money?

### Boarder Impact (Optional) 
- From a macroscopic point of view, how would my research make the world a better/worse place?

### Bibliography
Identify key references. It might not need to be as thorough as that of your final paper.

## Some tips
- Consider start with (nested) bullet points and build on top of it.
- Use formal language!
- Consider:
  - What makes your research novel and unique? 
  - Can your peer in this field understand your proposal?
