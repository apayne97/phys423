title: Peer-Review Discussion
---

- Did your peers tell you something about the paper that is working well / not working well that you didn't realize before?
- Did you peers have some specific knowledge on style and grammar that you didn't know of?
- Were there feedback that you didn't want to incorporate? If so, how did you react?
- Do you think your paper is in a better shape after peer-review session?
