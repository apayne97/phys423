## CCNY’s Statement on Community Standards

## Attendance 

Instructors can set their own attendance policies. CCNY recommends that students be allowed to miss a total of two weeks of class (4 class sessions for a class that meets twice a week, for example). Here is a sample policy:

Students are expected to attend every class session of this course and to be on time. If you miss five classes, your final grade will be dropped by one-half of one letter (a 90 to an 85, for example). If you miss six classes, your final grade will be dropped one full letter. If you miss seven classes, you will not be able to pass the course. Consistent late arrivals and early departures will have a negative impact on your grade. I will notify you by email if course absences (for full or partial classes) are having an impact on your grade. If you have special circumstances, please see me. I’m happy to work with you to help you complete this course. 

## Student Support Services Program, NAC 6/148

https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/sssp

SSSP invites new students, especially incoming freshmen and transfers at the start of fall, to join us up to our 500-student cap.  SSSP students should be either first-generation college students OR have a family income below a certain threshold.  SEEK students are not eligible to join as SSSP’s services in many ways mirror SEEK’s.  To apply, complete the application at  https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/sssp/sssp_application. Accepted students have full access to SSSP’s services, which include academic advising, personal counseling, and tutoring in the Academic Resource Center in Marshak 1104.  Tutoring supports all disciplines, and offers SSSP students the only online, 24/7 writing review service currently offered at City. Students requesting in-person writing tutoring are assigned to the same tutor for a series of meetings which can be weekly or customized to the students’ schedule of due dates.
